The objective of this project is to help people verify the freedom of a 
software project. The methods used will consist of scripts written 
around commonly used software on GNU/Linux.

If you have questions, ask the Savannah Hackers, since this project will
get most of the help and criticism from their mailing list.

So far the requirements:

	find_notice.sh:
	grep
	POSIX shell scripting environment
